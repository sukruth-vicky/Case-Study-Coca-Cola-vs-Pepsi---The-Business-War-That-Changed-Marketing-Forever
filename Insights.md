Insights: What the Cola Wars Teach

1. Challenger tactics (blind tests, perception attacks) can shift strong incumbents.  
2. Emotional and experiential branding outlasts functional claims.  
3. Personalization (like “Share a Coke”) deepens consumer loyalty.  
4. Marketing competition raises the bar for the entire industry.  
5. Diversification and adaptability are necessary—the Cola Wars didn’t stay about just cola.
